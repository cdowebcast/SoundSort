The code that used to power www.soundsort.com (I took it down for lack of engagement)

This is a web music player that utilizes SoundCloud's api to sort the latest hot (and free/downloadable) tracks.  Users can connect through Facebook, then vote, comment, or "favorite" songs.  All songs are downloadable for free (non-downloadable tracks are excluded).
